        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm from New York - the city that never sleeps! I'm very much a people
          person, and I have an inquisitive mind - which led me to study
          psychology at school. Ever since I can remember, I've had a thirst for
          knowledge and a desire to understand how things work. As a youngster,
          I would always take things apart to study or modify them, and attempt
          to fix broken items. I'm a tinkerer, critical thinker, and I always
          ask why.

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in Lambda's Full-Stack Web Development course.
          We've only just begun, but already I've learned so much! I am very
          excited for the future and to be able to see my growth over time. My
          goal is to become a front-end software engineer and app developer.

        <h3>Podcast</h3>
        <p>
          Just a few friends having fun exploring nerd culture. We argue, we
          laugh, we share our opinions, review video games, anime, movies,
          shows, manga, music and more! We also have a YouTube channel where we
          did press coverage of NYCC and Anime NYC!

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
          It's in my blood! Literally; my parents are both professional singers
          from Argentina that came over to the U.S. to tour! I've always loved
          music - especially Hip-Hop. Being from NYC, it is a huge part of the
          culture. I've been doing music on and off since the age of 15.

        <h3>Fun</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a pretty laid back, fun guy. I love to laugh and make people
          laugh, go out with friends, spend time with my family, enjoy the
          scenery and try something new. I also like to play video games and
          catch up on the latest Netflix series when I can!
